## **Overview**

According to "Workday Announces Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results," Workday is a $6.7B company which provides ERP software addressing the needs of mid-sized to enterprise-sized companies, largely answering the need for consolidated, actionable data delivered across human resources and financial departments. Although Workday provides everything from general ledger to supplier management to human capital management (HCM) software, it's the HCM-side that is the reason I chose them for this analysis because they are a competitor to ADP, one of the world's largest HCM providers. Further, as ADP and Workday have recently committed to greater partnerships in the future, I have an interest in understanding them better. Explaining the strengthened partnership, Maria Black, CEO of ADP, stated in "Workday and ADP Expand Partnership to Deliver Enhanced Global Payroll, Compliance, and HR for Joint Customers,"

> We are laser focused on providing smart, easy, and powerful solutions 
> that help our clients confidently achieve their goals, and enhanced integrations 
> provide the personalization we know they desire.

## **History**
From Dun & Bradstreet's company report, WorkDay, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2012; however, it first opened its doors in 2005 as a Nevada corporation, North Tahoe Power Tools, Inc. David Duffield & Aneel Bhusri, ERP software veterans began the company as a SaaS-based ERP company to compete directly with Oracle PeopleSoft. According to "How Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri Got Back at Oracle, published by *Forbes* in 2013, this largely had to do with a very public, hostile takeover of PeopleSoft (founded by Duffield who brought Bhusri in) by Oracle, Duffield's former employer. With the vast knowledge they had of Oracle and PeopleSoft from architecture to customers and shareholders, Duffield and Bhusri set out to build a better cloud-based solution to enteprise software serving the needs of finance and HR.

And, from the company's historical performance, their strategy worked. Crunchbase reports that on the date of their IPO (October 12, 2012), their stock price was $48.05. Just eleven years later, Stock Analysis reports that Workday's stock price is at $212.73. By comparison, ADP, a company more than 70 years old has a stock price of $218.57. 

## **Financials**
According to Tracxn Technologies, Workday has received $352M in funding, of which the latest round was $98.3M. They have more than 11,000 employees and are headquartered in Pleasanton, California. In looking at their market cap, Stock Analysis gives them a market cap of $55.8B whereas they provide a market cap for ADP of $89.9B. In terms of growth, Workday has been impressive. Stock Analysis reports that they grew $39.6% in the past year whereas ADP contracted by 9.2%. Dun & Bradstreet reports that they have a net worth of $5.94B, and as of August 25, 2023, their revenues have increased $500M over the past year.

Although only a piece of what Workday does, the HCM industry is a significant part of their strategy and the focus of this analysis. MarketsandMarkets estimates the size of the industry in their report, *Human Capital Managmeent Market by Component, Software (Core HR, Applicant Tracking System, HR Analytics, & Workforce Management), Services, Deployment Model, Organization Size, Vertical and Region (2022-2026)*, "The global Human Capital Management (HCM) Market size crossed $22.3 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to...reach over $32.0 billion by the end of 2026." As a company barely over a decade old with $6B in annual revenue, they have the product, the sales penetration, and the room to grow well into that $32B market.

## **Strategy**

The past ten years have seen significant shifts in the HCM industry. Originally started in 2005, David Duffield and Aneel Bhursri wanted to build an ERP system which was fully cloud-based from the start. Legacy ERP systems (Oracle, SAP) were costly to maintain for the companies and for the organizations implementing. As on-premise software, they were painful to update,  patch, and improve. The rise of cloud-based software (largely driven by Salesforce's popularity) demonstrated the ease of purchase, use, and maintenance of SaaS which then shifted into PaaS. This shift to PaaS is where Workday captured the market.

Now, if we look at the past five years, going back to 2019, the most significant changes in the world and resulting ways in which we work was driven by COVID-19. The change in how we work meant that computing in financial and human resources sectors had to be distributed, reliable, and secure. It also had to be always available because no one knew who was going to be working, when, or how. Systems had to be more reliable and secure than ever (with a surge in cyberattacks occurring). That drove the need for greater collaboration and ease of communication across individuals, teams, departments, and organizations. For Workday, that meant adding in more collaboration tools, both inside their systems and through integrations with other companies. Workday has made new investments into building and marketing their Marketplace which helps organizations from the SMB to the Fortune 500 add and use new applications which speak directly to their Workday system. An example of an integration is the relationship where a CFO may use Workday for their financial and human resources needs (GL, recruiting, hiring, performance management), but they maintain payroll through ADP. 

Now, as the pandemic dragged on, we saw new needs, particularly within human resources which was no longer *"How do we keep them physically safe and emotionally healthy?"* to *"How do we engage and retain employees in the most competitive labor market we've ever seen?"* to *"How do we measure productivity, keep them productive, and raise productivity levels to those pre-pandemic?"* That drove a new need for employee engagement and productivity measurement products and processes. For Workday, a company which has historically been on the forefront of building technology to drive productivity, that meant new explorations into AI and ML. A data-driven enterprise could make better informed decisions, and by providing data in the hands of those closest to the employees (direct managers) and then surfacing that data further up the chain, leaders could know where, when, and how to pivot as the market, industry, and economy changes. Corporations had lived through three years of near-constant change, leading up to last year with the release of ChatGPT.

As organizations look to how they can leverage generative AI within their internal systems and processes, some companies, like Workday, have already invested heavily into integrating generative AI into their customer-facing software. This is a move that is bold, risky for a financial system, and marks them as a leader in generative AI for HCM. Their larger, legacy ERP systems competitors like Oracle have such a breadth of systems and processes that they won't be able to be as strategic in how they integrate generative AI into their user flows because their systems are so complicated that they won't be able to as easily see downstream challenges, particularly those they create for users. In this, Workday has a unique competitive advantage, though I wouldn't call it an "unfair" advantage because I don't believe that a company operating strategically and ethically has an unfair advantage on anyone. What they are leveraging as the only significant financial and HR system that can compete with Oracle PeopleSoft, ADP, Ceridian, and UKG is the speed to execution they give their customers. Workday is the only one not weighted down by outdated architecture, along with the internal ways of working and mental models which slow down the path to innovation. 

And, we're already seeing how they are strategically leveraging their position in the market, their reputation as an innovation leader and their successes with partners to capture even more marketshare through new investments in AI companies. In "Workday Commits Additional $250 Million Investment Capital to Workday Ventures to Power Technology Innovation," Workday states that this  most recent investment represents, "the latest step in its journey to shape the future of work." This investment in AI companies is mirrored in ADP's strategy, marked by the October announcement in "ADP Launches Corporate Venture Capital Fund" that ADP is similarly seeking to invest in innovative companies with unique solutions to the HCM industry.

## **Tech Stack**

Workday's tech stack is comprehensive, and internal systems would be difficult to determine without internal connections. So, for the purpose of this analysis, I'm relying on a Medium article, "Sneak Peak into Workday's Technology Stack," written by one of Workday's engineers, Fergal Somers. Somers states one of the key components is The Workday Cloud Platform which "enables external developers to build with Workday by exposing our applications and technology via RESTful design-time and run-time APIs." He also writes about Worksheets, their collaboration technology which "enables users to slice and dice data within Workday and combine it with external sources in a high-fidelity, real-time spreadsheet UX."

One of the areas I've been most interested in is Workday's conversational AI which allows their customers' employees to interact with a chatbot in a conversational manner on everything from payroll to benefits questions which reduces the workload on HR and payroll departments while providing a faster, more intuitive user experience from a mobile device.

Somers further provides a look into their data analytics and machine learning aspects. Workday Prism Analytics allows analysts to aggregate data from Workday and non-Workday data sources, surfacing needed information. Workday Prism Analytics uses Spark and Hadoop "to process terabytes of data using massive parallelism." Then, on the ML side, Somers states that they use "a range of techniques from simple regression to complex deep learning." How this transpires in terms of the user experience is the ability to more easily find candidates, parse out data from expense receipts, forecast better, and understand the risk of attrition. Now, where they have gone from when this report was written in 2017 is leveraging AI/ML to go so far beyond search and retrieval of information. Workday now provides the ability to understand and build for skills gaps, determine highest performers who may be at risk for attrition and provide career pathing recommendations. But, with their recent investments, they're doing so much more. 

With the $250M investment commitment, Workday reports that Workday Ventures' investment in Auditoria "provides an AI-based platform to automate and increase the speed, accuracy, and productivity of accounts payable and receivable teams." Further, they're extending their conversational user experience by investing in Pardox to provide a conversational recruiting platform.

## **Recommendations**

With their impressive strategy which is resulting in unparalleled industry growth, it's hard to provide recommendations other than to keep doing whawt they're doing. However, some things I would recommend is for Workday to more closely lean into their partner marketplace, focusing attention on even more integrations. What this would allow them is the ability to tackle areas they currently don't offer, such as ADP's payroll, tax, and compliance solutions which may be part of their new partnership. 

Workday has done great work in terms of the individual employee experience which is mobile-first and provides a conversational interface for employees. However, with Gen Y and Millennials rapidly rising as the largest group of employees who will be replacing the workforce as Baby Boomers and Gen X retire, I'd recommend that they do more with their mobile app and employee-centric experience. For example, Gen Z and Millennials are not as financially secure as older generations, so providing them with financial products to help them better understand their pay, benefits, and expenses can help them save for what is at this time an uncertain future. They can take what they already have and build towards more employee-centric features which can also include partnerships with companies which provide access to paycheck funds (on a loan basis) before their actual pay day.

Through these new offerings, they can engage younger employees which helps them build brand recognition. So, as more junior employees grow up, their managers retire, and they take more leadership roles, they will know the value of Workday and may choose it over competing products when they have the ability to buy or influence buying decisions. Secondly, the additional engagement provides more data which can be captured and used by Workday to further analyze employee preferences. They can then provide the analysis of this new data to managers, leaders, and HR professionals as well as using it inside Workday to identify new products and services.

Finally, I'd recommend that as Workday looks for new ways of automating low-value manual work for organizations by leveraging AI/ML, they should look for more ways to enable and support more high-value work for all finance and HR professionals. Further, Workday could potentially explore a partnership with a company like Dun & Bradstreet, integrating D&Bs data into their product to streamline the credit & risk side of Finance from within their application. Additionally, Workday should consider how AI can be used to automate much of the time-consuming tasks related to recruiting and onboarding of new employees. Strategically, they need to focus on the human experience by really honing in on the *moments that matter* to customers. As AI becomes more commonplace in the enterprise, the human-to-human experience is going to become all the more valuable.

In conclusion, I am impressed with how Workday has grown from an idea over breakfast (as detailed in the "About Us" page) from two technology veterans who came through a very public hostile takeover (with not a little bad blood from David Duffield's former employer, Oracle) to a company which showed the industry what cloud-based software could be for enterprise companies. Now, I think they're showing us all in HCM what artificial intelligence and machine learning can be for the human experience.
